                    With the payment.js integration you can securely accept card payments and

                    without the need for redirecting to a separate payment form. 
                    The payment.js library renders 2 separate iFrames for card number and CVV/CVC in your checkout page. 
                    This reduces your PCI-DSS scope to as low as it can get (PCI-DSS SAQ-A).<br/><br/>
